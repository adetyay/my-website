      hey! i'm aditya. if you're into coding and cool projects, you're in the right place. i spend most of my time glued to my computer, making tech magic happen.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      i used to play piano, but now my fingers dance on the keyboard for coding. i'm a huge book fan—though let's be honest, buying books is the real excitement.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      when i'm not coding or hunting for my next book, you'll find me writing poems on my notes app. i love rock music, but soft indie hits the spot too. and yes, my favorite anime is one piece because, let's face it, who doesn't love a good adventure?

    <p class="my-4">luffy's my inspiration</p>
    <p class="my-4">
      i'm also a part-time philosopher, so if you enjoy deep, thought-provoking conversations, let's connect. who knows, we might just hit it off! (my discord: @psfr)!
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      enjoy your stay, and let's create some cool stuff together!
