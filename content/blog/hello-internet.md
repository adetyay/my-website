hey there! iâ€™m aditya, 21, from india. iâ€™m the guy who sees magic in every line of code and beauty in every pixel.

letâ€™s get this out of the way - i used to be a total nerd in school. now iâ€™m justâ€¦ a different kind of nerd. these days, i spend a fair bit of time tinkering with code and dreaming up cool project ideas. but donâ€™t worry, i wonâ€™t bore you with tech talk.

fun fact: i used to play piano, but now my fingers dance on the keyboard for coding. i love reading booksâ€”though letâ€™s be honest, buying books is the real excitement.

when iâ€™m not buried in a book or lost in the digital world, iâ€™m probably scribbling down poems in my phoneâ€™s notes app. theyâ€™re not exactly franz kafka, but they keep me sane. i love rock music, but soft indie hits the spot too. and yes, my favorite anime is one piece, i just wanna sail the grand line with luffy and the gang.

i also fancy myself a bit of a philosopher. so if youâ€™re up for some deep, potentially nonsensical conversations about life, the universe, and everything, iâ€™m your guy. **(my discord: @psfr)**!

i enjoy sunrises and all the simple joys that come with them. ðŸŒ„

anyway, thatâ€™s me. stick around, maybe weâ€™ll cook up something cool together. or at the very least, we can debate whether buying books counts as a hobby. (spoiler alert: i think it does.)

thatâ€™s all for now - stay awesome, folks!
