### welcome to aditya’s world
hey! i'm aditya. if you’re into coding and cool projects, you’re in the right place. i spend most of my time glued to my computer, making tech magic happen.

i used to be all about basketball, but these days, my dribbling skills are limited to debugging code. i’m a huge book fan—though let’s be honest, buying books is the real excitement.

when i'm not coding or hunting for my next book, you'll find me writing poems on my notes app. and yes, one piece is my go-to anime because, well, who doesn’t love an epic adventure?

i’m also a part-time philosopher, so if you enjoy deep, thought-provoking conversations, let’s connect. who knows, we might just hit it off!

stick around and let’s create something amazing together!
